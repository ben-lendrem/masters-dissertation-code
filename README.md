# masters-dissertation-code

Greetings!
The code in this repository is (partially) the code I submitted for my dissertation project as part of my master's in Computer Game Engineering. The code includes a renderering library written in OpenGL, provided by Newcastle University, and added to by myself as part of previous modules and the master's project itself.
The system produces a particle system, that launches particles from a start point, and varies each particles attributes as the simulation progresses.

PLEASE NOTE!!!!!!!!!
The multithreaded part of this system DOES NOT WORK AT THIS POINT IN TIME. This is because the original multithreaded approach I submitted performed extremely poorly, and as such I have been working on improving it since the end of my master's course. The multithreaded approach has not been finished yet, and as such attempting to modify the code so that it runs with multithreading enabled will not work.
I hope that you (the reader) will not hold this against me, as I am still learning, and work with the aim of continuing this learning for a very very, VERY long time.

:) Ben
